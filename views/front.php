    <p>All codepoints are arranged in 16Â so-called
       <a href="<?php e($router->getUrl('planes'))?>">planes</a>. These planes
       are further divided in several blocks with
       <a href="<?php e($router->getUrl('/basic_latin'))?>">Basic Latin</a>
       being the first one.
       You can browse one by one by starting with the first codepoint,
       <a href="<?php e($router->getUrl('/U+0000'))?>">U+0000</a>.
       Or maybe you are more daring and want
       <a href="<?php e($router->getUrl('random'))?>">a random codepoint</a>?
