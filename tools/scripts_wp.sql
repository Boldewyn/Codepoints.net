<p>The Aramaic alphabet is historically significant, since virtually all modern Middle Eastern writing systems use a script that can be traced back to it, as well as numerous Altaic writing systems of Central and East Asia. This is primarily due to the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a <i>lingua franca</i> and the official language of the Neo-Assyrian, and its successor, the Achaemenid Empire. Among the scripts in modern use, the Hebrew alphabet bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BCE, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes.</p>
<p>Writing systems that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels (like the Aramaic one) or indicate them with added diacritical signs, have been called abjads by Peter T. Daniels to distinguish them from later alphabets, such as Greek, that represent vowels more systematically. This is to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a syllabary or an alphabet, which implies that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary (as argued by Gelb) or an incomplete or deficient alphabet (as most other writers have said); rather, it is a different type.</p>', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic_script' );

<p>Modern Gurmukhi has forty-one consonants (<i>vianjan</i>), nine vowel symbols (<i>lāga mātrā</i>), two symbols for nasal sounds (<i>bindī</i> and <i>ṭippī</i>), and one symbol which duplicates the sound of any consonant (<i>addak</i>). In addition, four conjuncts are used: three subjoined forms of the consonants Rara, Haha and Vava, and one half-form of Yayya. Use of the conjunct forms of Vava and Yayya is increasingly scarce in modern contexts.</p>
<p>Gurmukhi is primarily used in the Punjab state of India where it is the sole official script for all official and judicial purpose. The script is also widely used in the Indian states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and the national capital of Delhi, with Punjabi being one of the official language in these states. Gurmukhi has been adapted to write other languages, such as Braj Bhasha, Khariboli (and other Hindustani dialects), Sanskrit and Sindhi.

<p>Traditional Chinese characters are currently used in Hong Kong, Macau, and Republic of China (Taiwan). Overseas Chinese communities generally use traditional characters, but simplified characters are often used among mainland Chinese immigrants.</p>
<p>Simplified character forms were created by decreasing the number of strokes and simplifying the forms of a sizable proportion of traditional Chinese characters. Some simplifications were based on popular cursive forms embodying graphic or phonetic simplifications of the traditional forms. Some characters were simplified by applying regular rules, for example, by replacing all occurrences of a certain component with a simplified version of the component. Variant characters with same pronunciation and identical meaning were reduced to one single standardized character, usually the simplest amongst all variants in form. Finally, many characters were left untouched by simplification, and are thus identical between the traditional and simplified Chinese orthographies.</p>
<p>Some simplified characters are very dissimilar to and unpredictable from traditional characters, especially in those where a component is replaced by an arbitrary and simplistic symbol. This often leads opponents not well-versed in the method of simplification to conclude that the ''overall process'' of character simplification is also arbitrary. In reality, the methods and rules of simplification are few and internally consistent. On the other hand, proponents of simplification often flaunt a few choice simplified characters as ingenious inventions, when in fact these have existed for hundreds of years as ancient variants. The debate over the use of traditional versus simplified Chinese characters continues in Chinese-speaking countries.</p>
<p>A second round of simplifications was promulgated in 1977, but was later retracted for a variety of reasons.

The present "square script" Hebrew alphabet is a stylized version of the Aramaic alphabet which was adopted from that used by the Persian Empire (which in turn was adopted from the Arameans). After the fall of the Persian Empire, Jews used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form.

These three scripts were discovered and named by Arthur Evans. In 1952, Michael Ventris discovered that Linear B was being used to write the early form of Greek known as Mycenaean.

<p>The alphabet consists of 24 letters: the 22 letters of the Aramaic alphabet with two additional letters at the end. As the number 24 is auspicious for Mandaeans (it is the number of hours from sunset to sunset), the additional letters are somewhat artificial. The 23rd letter is <i>adu</i>, the relative particle (cf. Arabic tāʾ marbūṭa, Coptic letter "ti", and English ampersand). And the 24th is the first letter, <i>a</i>, repeated. Thus, Mandaeans say that the abagada has perfected the alpha and omega.</p>
<p>Unlike most other Semitic alphabets, the vowels are usually written out in full. The first and last letter, <i>a</i> (corresponding to <i>alaph</i>), is used to represent a range of open vowels. The sixth letter, <i>wa</i>, is used for close back vowels (<i>u</i> and <i>o</i>), and the tenth letter, <i>ya</i> is used for close front vowels (<i>i</i> and <i>e</i>). These last two can also serve as the consonants <i>w/v</i> and <i>y</i>. The eighth letter corresponds to the Semitic <i>heth</i>, and is called <i>eh</i>; it always is pronounced as a long <i>i</i>-vowel, but is rarely used as it is thought to be a sacred representation of the eye of God. A similar situation exists for the sixteenth letter, <i>e</i> (Aramaic <i>ayn</i>), which usually represents <i>e</i> at the beginning of a word, or, when followed by <i>wa</i> or <i>ya</i>, for initial <i>u</i> or <i>i</i> respectively.</p>
<p>All the letters in the Mandaic alphabet are considered by Mandaeans to have magic properties, and impart mysteries (<i>raze</i>). A hint at a few of these meanings is given alongside the respective letters.</p>

The detailed analysis was given by <b>Dr. Byomkes Chakrabarti</b> in his ''Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali''.

<p>Phoenician became one of the most widely used writing systems, spread by Phoenician merchants across the Mediterranean world, where it was assimilated by many other cultures and evolved.

The introduction of Christian materials in the script that Pollard invented caused a great impact among the Lisu. Part of the reason was that they had a legend about how their ancestors had possessed a script but lost it. According to the legend, the script would be brought back some day. When the script was introduced, many Lisu came from far away to see and learn it (Enwall 1994).</p>
<p>Pollard credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabics designed by James Evans in 1838–1841, “While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done” (1919:174). He also gave credit to a Chinese pastor, “Stephen Lee assisted me very ably in this matter, and at last we arrived at a system” (1919:174). In listing the phrases he used to describe devising the script, there is clear indication of intellectual work, not revelation: “we looked about”, “resolved to attempt”, “adapting the system”, “solved our problem” (Pollard 1919:174,175).</p>
<p>Changing politics in China led to the use of several competing scripts, most of which were romanizations. The Pollard script remains popular among Hmong in China, although Hmong outside China tend to use one of the alternative scripts. A revision of the script was completed in 1988, which remains in use.</p>
<p>As with most other abugidas, the Pollard letters represent consonants, whereas vowels are indicated by diacritics. Uniquely, however, the position of this diacritic is varied to represent tone.

Runology is the study of the runic alphabets, runic inscriptions, runestones, and their history. Runology forms a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics.</p>
<p>The earliest runic inscriptions date from around AD 150. The characters were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianization by around AD 700 in central Europe and by around AD 1100 in Northern Europe. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in Northern Europe. Until the early 20th century runes were used in rural Sweden for decoration purposes in Dalarna and on Runic calendars.</p>
<p>The three best-known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark (around 150–800), the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc (400–1100), and the Younger Futhark (800–1100). The Younger Futhark is further divided into the long-branch runes (also called <i>Danish</i>, although they were also used in Norway and Sweden), short-branch or Rök runes (also called <i>Swedish-Norwegian</i>, although they were also used in Denmark), and the stavesyle or Hälsinge runes (staveless runes).

Which variant of the Old Italic family in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain, suggestions including Raetic, Etruscan or Old Latin candidates. All these scripts at the time had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy which would become characteristic of the runes.

Although the baybayin does share some, there is no evidence that it is this old.</p>', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin' );
INSERT INTO script_abstract ( sc, abstract, src ) VALUES ( 'Thaa', '<p><b>Thaana</b>, <b>Taana</b> or <b>Tāna</b> (written <big>ތާނަ‎</big> in Tāna script) is the modern writing system of the Divehi language spoken in the Maldives. Taana has characteristics of both an abugida (diacritic, vowel-killer strokes) and a true alphabet (all vowels are written), with consonants derived from indigenous and Arabic numerals, and vowels derived from the vowel diacritics of the Arabic abjad. Its orthography is largely phonemic.</p>
<p>The Tāna script first appeared in a Maldivian document towards the beginning of the 18th century in a crude initial form known as Gabulhi Thaana which was written <i>scripta continua</i>. This early script slowly developed, its characters slanting 45 degrees, becoming more graceful and spaces were added between words. As time went by it gradually replaced the older Dhives Akuru alphabet. The oldest written sample of the Thaana script is found in the island of Kanditheemu in <i>Northern Miladhunmadulu Atoll</i>. It is inscribed on the door posts of the main <i>Hukuru Miskiy</i> (Friday mosque) of the island and dates back to 1008 AH (AD 1599) and 1020 AH (AD 1611) when the roof of the building were built and the renewed during the reigns of Ibrahim Kalaafaan (Sultan Ibrahim III) and Hussain Faamuladeyri Kilege (Sultan Hussain II) respectively.</p>
<p>Thaana, like Arabic, is written right to left. It indicates vowels with diacritic marks derived from Arabic. Each letter must carry either a vowel or a <i>sukun</i> (which indicates "no vowel"). The only exception to this rule is <i>nūnu</i> which, when written without a diacritic, indicates prenasalization of a following stop.</p>
<p>The vowel or diacritical signs are called <i>fili</i> in Divehi; there are five <i>fili</i> for short vowels (a,i,u,e,o), where the first two look identical to the Arabic vowel signs (<i>fatha</i> and <i>kasra</i>) and the third one (damma) looks somewhat similar. Long vowels (ā, ē, ī, ō and ū) are denoted by doubled <i>fili</i> (except ō, which is a modification of the short <i>obofili</i>).</p>


<p>The letter <i>alifu</i> has no sound value of its own and is used for three different purposes: It can act as a carrier for a vowel with no preceding consonant, that is, a word-initial vowel or the second part of a diphthong; when it carries a <i>sukun</i>, it indicates gemination (lengthening) of the following consonant; and if <i>alifu</i>+<i>sukun</i> occurs at the end of a word, it indicates that the word ends in /eh/. Gemination of nasals, however, is indicated by <i>nūnu</i>+sukun preceding the nasal to be geminated.</p>', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaana' );
